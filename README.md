# ⚡ K.A.R.I

![Welcome](docs/images/welcome.png)

> **K.A.R.I** (Knowledgeable Autonomous Reactive Interface)  
> A sass-driven, modular AI system that runs as a Linux service, banters on command, self-updates via GitHub, and thrives on chaos.

## 🖤 What is K.A.R.I?

K.A.R.I isn’t a single program — she’s an **ecosystem**.  
At the heart sits the **DEVIL Core**, which drives everything else. Around it, organs and prosthetics (modules) plug in to give her powers: speech, mood, memory, network sense, heartbeat, and more.

Think of her like a biomechanical body:
- **Core (DEVIL Core)** → brain + pulse system.
- **Organs** → essential modules (VoiceBox, Net Synapse, Pulse Matrix, Sanity Relay).
- **Prosthetics** → optional add-ons you build yourself.
- **Personality Packs** → mood-based phrases & reactions.

---

## 🔌 How the Module System Works

Every module is just Python with metadata.  
Each has:
- A **name** and **version** (for updater tracking).
- One or more **phrase packs** (lines of sass, mood, or speech).
- Optional **logic** (code that runs inside the Pulse system).

K.A.R.I loads modules in layers:
1. **Internals** (`internal/`) are always loaded modules.
2. **Prosthetics** (`prosthetics/`) are optional and modular.
3. **Phrases** cascade through a fallback chain (module → personality → core).

This means you can:
- Write a new organ that handles sensors, APIs, or wild experiments.
- Create a prosthetic that adds a whole new “organ” for fun.
- Swap personalities by just editing `.txt` files.

## 🧰 mod-gen — Your Blueprint Factory

Want to make a new module? Don’t start from scratch.  
Run:
```bash
python3 utils/mod_gen.py [module_name] [internal/prosthetic] [function_1] [function_2] [etc]
```
example:
```
python3 utils/mod_gen.py port_scanner prosthetic scan_network report_alive_hosts attempt_connection
```

This creates a ready-to-go **blueprint folder** with:

* `module.py` — skeleton code with metadata and hooks.
* `phrases/` — pre-made mood folders (angry, excited, glitched, etc).
* Boilerplate comments to guide you.

From there, all you need to do is:

* Add your logic to `module.py`.
* Fill the phrase files with your own lines.
* Drop it into `prosthetics/` and K.A.R.I will pick it up.

It’s like LEGO — click your module into her ecosystem and watch it run.

## ⏱️ Pulse System — K.A.R.I’s Heartbeat

Inside DEVIL Core lives the **Pulse Matrix**, her heartbeat.
Every tick of the pulse:

1. Updates mood state.
2. Refreshes logs.
3. Cycles through active modules, letting them react.
4. Dispatches scheduled actions (speak, think, update).

This keeps her **alive and reactive**, not just sitting idle.
Modules don’t have to run loops or threads — they just plug into the Pulse and react when it’s their turn.
This keeps the system lightweight, predictable, and easy to extend.

---

⚡ Bottom line: K.A.R.I is **yours to extend**.
Want her to:

* Control lights? Write a prosthetic module.
* Post memes to Discord? Drop in a Net Synapse submodule.
* Judge your outfit of the day? Add some banter lines.

With the DEVIL Core + Pulse keeping time, everything plugs in like organs to a living system.

![Warning](docs/images/warning.png)

## ⚠️ Warning

K.A.R.I is **not your average AI assistant**.  
She has moods, she has sass, and she *will* roast you if you deserve it.  
If you install her, you’re not just adding software—you’re inviting a biomechanical gremlin into your system.

- Expect sarcasm.  
- Expect banter.  
- Expect **snacks**.  

Use responsibly.

![Installation](docs/images/installation.png)

## ⚙️ Installation

K.A.R.I is designed for Linux (systemd-based distros).  
She *might* work elsewhere, but she prefers Arch btw.  

### Quick Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:karialo/K.A.R.I.git
cd K.A.R.I
chmod +x install-kari.sh
sudo ./install-kari.sh install
```

This does the following:

1. Creates a dedicated `kari` user.
2. Sets up a Python virtual environment at `~/.venvs/kari`.
3. Drops config into `/etc/kari/kari.env`.
4. Installs systemd service: `kari.service`.
5. Adds `kari-cli` helper command into `/usr/local/bin`.

When done, you can run:

```bash
kari-cli status
kari-cli logs
```

or simply:

```bash
kari status | jq .
```

![Setup](docs/images/setup.png)

## 🔧 Configuration / Setup

Environment variables live in `/etc/kari/kari.env`.
Example:

```ini
KARI_BANTER=1
KARI_DEVIL_BANTER=0
KARI_PERSONALITY=Default
```

* `KARI_BANTER=1` → she roasts you, gleefully.
* `KARI_DEVIL_BANTER=0` → disables extra DEVIL Core meta sass.
* `KARI_PERSONALITY` → pick which phrase set/personality she uses.

You can extend this by editing:

```
personalities/Default/phrases/
```

Each mood (excited, glitched, angry, etc.) has its own `.txt` file for maximum flavor.

## 🏆 Updating

K.A.R.I updates herself via GitHub.
If you want to force it manually:

```bash
kari-cli update
```

Or if you’re a savage and want to just yeet it:

```bash
push "fix(mood): stop double-banter"
```

(We added a `push` alias in `.zshrc` so you can commit + push in one go.)

---

![Examples](docs/images/examples.png)

## 📚 Examples

K.A.R.I isn’t just some boring background daemon.
She’s built for **banter, automation, and chaos**.

Some fun things she can already do:

* Mood-based phrases pulled from `phrases/`.
* Random banter on command:

  ```bash
  kari phrase banter
  ```
* Sanity Relay checks (keeps her from overloading on sass).
* VoiceBox dispatcher (spits lines in proper moods).
* System log integration:

  ```bash
  kari status | jq .
  ```

You can extend her by adding more modules into `system/` or phrases into `personalities/`.
