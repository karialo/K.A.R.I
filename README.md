## üñ§ What is K.A.R.I?

K.A.R.I isn‚Äôt one binary‚Äîshe‚Äôs an **ecosystem**.  
At the center lives the **D.E.V.I.L. Core** (the conductor). Around it, ‚Äúorgans‚Äù (internal modules) and ‚Äúprosthetics‚Äù (your add-ons) plug in to give her new abilities.

- **DEVIL Core** ‚Äî loader, orchestrator, socket server, and **pulse dispatcher**.  
- **Organs** (`internal/`) ‚Äî essential modules that always ship (VoiceBox, Memory Cortex, Net Synapse, etc).  
- **Prosthetics** (`prosthetics/`) ‚Äî optional modules you add.  
- **Personality packs** ‚Äî mood-scoped phrase files (angry, happy, glitched‚Ä¶) that drive banter.

> Note: There is also a **Pulse Matrix** internal module that tracks *vitals* (CPU, mem, temps).  
> The **DEVIL Core pulse dispatcher** described below is separate‚Äîit‚Äôs the tick system that runs your code.

---

## üîå How modules load

On boot, DEVIL Core scans `internal/` and `prosthetics/` and loads any Python file that has:

- a top-level `meta_data` dict, and  
- a class named after the file in `CapWords` (e.g. `voice_box.py` ‚Üí class `VoiceBox`).

While attaching, DEVIL Core:
- binds `module.core = self` so modules can talk to the Core,  
- calls `init()` (sync) and/or `initialize()` (async) if present,  
- propagates `debug`/`trace`,  
- marks readiness, and  
- tries to speak a boot line via VoiceBox (with phrase fallbacks).

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è DEVIL Core **Pulse Dispatcher** (the heartbeat loop)

The runtime loop in `DEVILCore.run_forever()` ticks on an interval (defaults to **5s**, configurable).  
On every tick it calls `DEVILCore.pulse()`, which:

1. Bumps `tick_count` and exposes it at `core.data_store["tick"]`.  
2. Iterates **every attached module**.  
3. Reads `module.meta_data["pulse"]` (a list of method names to invoke each tick).  
4. Calls each method (async methods are scheduled with `asyncio.create_task`, sync methods run inline).  
5. Logs errors as WARNs without crashing the loop.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep pulse work **short**. Heavy/slow I/O should be async or throttled inside your method.

**Excerpt (simplified)**:
```python
def pulse(self):
    self.tick_count += 1
    self.data_store["tick"] = self.tick_count
    for mod in list(self.modules.values()):
        for action in mod.meta_data.get("pulse", []):
            method = getattr(mod, action, None)
            if callable(method):
                if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(method):
                    asyncio.create_task(method())
                else:
                    method()
```

![Warning](docs/images/warning.png)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

K.A.R.I is **not your average AI assistant**.  
She has moods, she has sass, and she *will* roast you if you deserve it.  
If you install her, you‚Äôre not just adding software‚Äîyou‚Äôre inviting a biomechanical gremlin into your system.

- Expect sarcasm.  
- Expect banter.  
- Expect **snacks**.  

Use responsibly.

![Installation](docs/images/installation.png)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

K.A.R.I is designed for Linux (systemd-based distros).  
She *might* work elsewhere, but she prefers Arch btw.  

### Quick Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:karialo/K.A.R.I.git
cd K.A.R.I
chmod +x install-kari.sh
sudo ./install-kari.sh install
```

This does the following:

1. Creates a dedicated `kari` user.
2. Sets up a Python virtual environment at `~/.venvs/kari`.
3. Drops config into `/etc/kari/kari.env`.
4. Installs systemd service: `kari.service`.
5. Adds `kari-cli` helper command into `/usr/local/bin`.

When done, you can run:

```bash
kari-cli status
kari-cli logs
```

or simply:

```bash
kari status | jq .
```

![Setup](docs/images/setup.png)

## üîß Configuration / Setup

Environment variables live in `/etc/kari/kari.env`.
Example:

```ini
KARI_BANTER=1
KARI_DEVIL_BANTER=0
KARI_PERSONALITY=Default
```

* `KARI_BANTER=1` ‚Üí she roasts you, gleefully.
* `KARI_DEVIL_BANTER=0` ‚Üí disables extra DEVIL Core meta sass.
* `KARI_PERSONALITY` ‚Üí pick which phrase set/personality she uses.

You can extend this by editing:

```
personalities/Default/phrases/
```

Each mood (excited, glitched, angry, etc.) has its own `.txt` file for maximum flavor.

![Winner](docs/images/winner.png)

## üèÜ Updating

K.A.R.I updates herself via GitHub.
If you want to force it manually:

```bash
kari-cli update
```

Or if you‚Äôre a savage and want to just yeet it:

```bash
push "fix(mood): stop double-banter"
```

(We added a `push` alias in `.zshrc` so you can commit + push in one go.)

---

![Examples](docs/images/examples.png)

## üìö Examples

K.A.R.I isn‚Äôt just some boring background daemon.
She‚Äôs built for **banter, automation, and chaos**.

Some fun things she can already do:

* Mood-based phrases pulled from `phrases/`.
* Random banter on command:

  ```bash
  kari phrase banter
  ```
* Sanity Relay checks (keeps her from overloading on sass).
* VoiceBox dispatcher (spits lines in proper moods).
* System log integration:

  ```bash
  kari status | jq .
  ```

You can extend her by adding more modules into `system/` or phrases into `personalities/`.
