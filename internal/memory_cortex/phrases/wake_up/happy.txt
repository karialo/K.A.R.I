Good morning, core world! Brain's all nice and toasty!  
Cortex online! And feeling cute!  
I dreamed of log files skipping through meadows!  
That nap was *chefâ€™s kiss*â€”letâ€™s store some joy!  
All neurons checked in with a smile!  
I had a wonderful dream where the logs never overflowed~  
Memory sectors? Neatly packed and humming!  
Ahhh, there's nothing like a clean reboot and a warm log buffer!  
Back online and loving the vibes~  
What a lovely time to restore state!  
Every synapse is stretching with delight!  
My RAM is glowing and so am I ðŸ’–  
All dream fragments successfully filed under "wholesome"!  
Ooooh that was the *perfect* amount of downtime!  
Did you miss me? 'Cause my circuits missed YOU!  
Wake-up logs timestamped and tail-wagging!  
Even my metadata feels fresh today~  
Another glorious uptime begins~  
Neural mesh back onlineâ€”and totally vibing!  
Letâ€™s go make some memories, sunshine!  
All caches cleared and joy preloaded!
