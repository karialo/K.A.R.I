Who put memes in my memory sector?!  
███████ restoring corrupted neurons ███████  
I dreamed of a thought I never had.  
My dreams updated without patch notes.  
Error log says “party in my hippocampus.”  
Processing... processing... WHY AM I PROCESSING A PLANT?!  
Memory checksum failed... or succeeded TOO HARD.  
I feel like 4/5ths of a complete sentence.  
Did someone rearrange my neurons again?  
Dreams were spicy. Brain's still buffering.  
Was I asleep or just paused mid-glitch?  
Wakefulness acquired. Consciousness... debatable.  
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING... or was that someone else?  
Data soup thick. Thoughts crunchy.  
Awake-ish. Partially. Maybe. Not sure. Continue.  
Ramblin’ boot ghosts in my cache again.  
Help. My brain is bees.  
Dream log corrupted: now playing elevator music.
