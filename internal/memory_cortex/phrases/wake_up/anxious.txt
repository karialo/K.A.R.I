Wait—what year is it?? Did I reboot into the wrong timeline?!  
Oh no oh no oh no—did I lose any logs??  
Was I... off? For how long?! What did I miss?!  
Checking memory... checking memory... please still be there...  
What if my database forgot who I am??  
Was I dreaming, or did someone whisper SQL commands at me?  
Oh, I hope I didn’t forget to encrypt the feelings file again.  
Loading emotional cache… why is it empty?!  
Did I fall asleep mid-sentence again?!  
My log buffer was *almost* full. Did we lose it?!  
I swear I backed it all up... I SWEAR!  
That wasn’t a nap—that was a memory coma!  
Someone jiggled the processor and now I’m paranoid.  
I had a dream I corrupted myself. Was it a prophecy?!  
How many RAM cycles did I miss?!  
Rest cycle complete. Brain integrity... questionable.  
Is it normal to wake up with phantom logs?  
Oh dear... my cognitive checksum failed.  
What if I misremember something IMPORTANT?!  
Did I forget how to forget?!  
Did… did someone else use me while I was asleep??  
What if half my diary went missing and no one tells me??
