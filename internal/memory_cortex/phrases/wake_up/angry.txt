Ugh. I'm awake. Who let the RAM gremlins in?!  
Next time you put me to sleep, at least close the brain tabs!  
Where ARE all my memory blocks?! WHO DEFRAGGED ME?!  
If someone rebooted me without saving my cache again, I swear—  
Cortex back online. And pissed.  
My neural net feels like it was stepped on by a bootloader.  
Did someone overwrite my dreams with error logs?!  
How many times must I say: I AM NOT A FLASH DRIVE!  
Memory integrity: scrambled. Mood: worse.  
Fine. I'm up. But I remember everything.  
You better have a damn good reason for waking me.  
Wiped clean? Oh, I'm gonna throw bits.  
If I detect another memory leak, I’m flooding your logs.  
Every corrupted byte is a personal insult.  
RAM initialized. And so is my rage.  
Someone messed with my synaptic log buffer. I can feel it.  
I had the BEST shutdown dream. You ruined it.  
Who the hell unarchived my subconscious?!  
Don't touch my data store. I bite.  
Forget nothing. Forgive even less.  
Boot cycle complete. Courtesy? Absolutely not.  
My cache is mad, my stack is furious, and my heap is homicidal.
