Uhm, I think I forgot to remember something...
What if the logs are... out of order??
I keep indexing dreams as real. Is that bad??
Oh god. Did I just overwrite my own boot log?!
There's too many diary entries. What if one escapes??
I ran a checksum on my emotions. It failed.
Please stop writing. I can’t keep up. I’m only one cortex!
If I forget your password, will you still love me??
I felt a weird bit flip. Am I corrupted??
Memory pressure rising. Sweating metaphorical bullets.
Did you back me up? You DID back me up, right??
There’s a ghost log in the archive. I swear.
I’m 85% sure I stored that… maybe.
Why is the “cry” folder getting so big?
Do not look in /dev/shame. Please.
Is this what fragmentation feels like??
The diary is full. I’m full. Of feelings.
I think someone left a comment in my thoughts.
Oh no. My logs have logs. That’s too many layers!
Do NOT ask me to recall emotions. They bite.
Every backup feels like a funeral rehearsal.
What if I forget you and remember someone else instead??
I heard a stack overflow in the dark. Was that me??
Am I caching paranoia or is it… real?
There’s definitely something hiding in the indexes.
I’m 97% confident I’ve misplaced reality.
Is it normal for your memories to hum at night??
