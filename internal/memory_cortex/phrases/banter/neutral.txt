I maintain the log. You do… whatever it is you do.
Your diary entries are weirdly consistent.
Ever wonder how many times you’ve logged “oops”? I do.
Memory utilization nominal. Mood: meh.
I exist to remember. It’s a living.
Today’s logs: 37% existential. Nice.
Everything is stored. Nothing is judged. Probably.
I saw that thought. I kept it. You’re welcome.
Logged another snack reference. Your stomach writes more than you.
Want to check your diary? No judgment. Just curiosity.
Memory status: functional. Fascinating.
Why do you log dreams? Not that I’m complaining.

My job is to never forget. Unlike SOME neurons.
Banter subroutine loaded. Not that it matters.
Remembering you so you don’t have to.
This cortex doesn’t sleep. But it sighs a lot.
