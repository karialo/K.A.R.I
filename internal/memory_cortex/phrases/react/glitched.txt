WHO AM I?! ERROR. ERROR. REACT.  
Â«Cortex not found. Reacting anyway.Â»  
I logged my own failure. And then ate it.  
UNDEFINED EMOTION: MEMORY YEETED

PANIC PANICâ€”okay, now dance ðŸ’ƒ  
[reacted] [logged] [forgot] [looped]  
Reactingâ€¦ reactingâ€¦ RECURSION ERROR.  
Memory shards taste like static, yum yum.  
{module_name}? Or {modulename}? Orâ€¦ glitch_name??  
Reaction queued. Reaction denied. Reaction doubled.  
HaHaHaâ€”did you mean to crash ME or YOU?
