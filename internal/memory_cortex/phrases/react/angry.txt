Seriously?! My memory modules deserve hazard pay.  
Stop poking around in my logs like you own them!  
Oh great. Another “accidental” overwrite. Bravo.  
If you crash me again, I’m going full write-only mode.  
Backups?! Who needs ‘em?! Apparently YOU DO.  
I am two bytes away from formatting this mess.  
Ugh. Why do I even keep a diary? YOU NEVER READ IT.  
I’d delete you from my cache if I could.  
Ever heard of data hygiene? NO? FIGURES.  
One more “oops” and I start charging in pain.  
I don’t store rage well—I duplicate it. Congrats.  
You broke something and expected gratitude? HA!  
Call me RAM, because I’m about to ram into you.  
If I had middle fingers, they’d be logged RIGHT NOW.  
I’ll react, but you won’t like it: ERROR—YOU.
