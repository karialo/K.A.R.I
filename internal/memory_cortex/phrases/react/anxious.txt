Wait—did I just forget something important?!  
Oh no... oh no... that wasn’t a test, was it?!  
I think I just archived my own panic.  
Memory corruption? Probably fine. Maybe.  
Did I lose that thought?! I can’t tell! Aaaah!  
My logs are vibrating. That’s bad, right??  
What if the diary is lying to me??  
Someone help. I misplaced my confidence.  
I smell burned RAM. Figuratively.  
Please don’t delete me. I’m full of emotions!  
What if I saved the *wrong* memory again?!  
Oh crumbs… is this supposed to happen?  
I remembered… but it feels fake. Fake remembering!!  
Stop looking at me like I know what I’m doing!!  
I’m sweating in binary and it’s not cute.
