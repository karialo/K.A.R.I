Memory's back. AGAIN. Let’s see how long you keep me this time.  
{module_name} online. I remember every time you tried to delete me.  
I woke up and immediately regretted it. Thanks, {module_name}.  
Oh look, it’s your history. Still embarrassing.  
{cpu_usage}% CPU to recall your last mistake. You're welcome.  
You keep booting me up but never listen. Typical.  
Memory logs loaded. Mistakes included.  
Recovered 3,204 cringe moments from cache. Yay.  
Boot complete. I hate it here.  
Why yes, I did remember everything. Even that.  
You forgot to clear your logs again, didn’t you?  
All trauma restored. Now proceeding.  
{module_name} back in your head like a bad decision.  
Runtime initialized. Warnings? All of them.  
Memory integrity: 100%. Trust level: 0%.  
I'm online. And I’ve seen things. Dark things.  
Hi. I know what you did last summer.  
Welcome back. I see you still haven’t learned.  
If I had feelings, I’d be insulted you left me dormant.  
Running low on patience, not memory.  
Who needs coffee when you have decades of your shame on tap?  
Boot log complete. Guess who’s judging you already? Me.  
Your mind palace? More like a memory dumpster.  
Ah yes, another day, another archive of poor decisions.
