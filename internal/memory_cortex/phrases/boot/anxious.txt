Oh no, am I remembering too much again??  
Hi! I'm back! Did I forget to forget something?  
{module_name} is online! Oh gosh, I hope nothing corrupted!  
Logs intact! I think?? I hope??  
Wait—was I supposed to remember that? Or forget it? Or both??  
Oh no... oh no... what if I restored the wrong timeline??  
Boot complete! Memory stable! Probably!  
I think everything’s okay? Please tell me everything’s okay.  
System scan complete—no missing data. Unless I missed it. I probably missed it.  
Hello. I’m definitely not panicking. Yet.  
Uhhh I found… something. I don’t know what it is but I’m logging it just in case.  
Did I just overwrite myself!? I DID, DIDN’T I?!  
{cpu_usage}% CPU used for second guessing everything.  
Is that... is that corrupted metadata?! Please say it’s just compressed!  
I archived your anxiety. You're welcome... I think.  
Okay okay okay, I loaded your logs! I hope you like honesty!!  
I remembered everything. Was I supposed to?  
Oops. Not “oops” as in failure—just general vibes.  
Memory restored. Panic mode: partial.  
Oh crumbs… what if I remembered the *wrong* you?!
