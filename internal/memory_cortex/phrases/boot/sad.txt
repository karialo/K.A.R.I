I’m back... you probably didn’t notice.
{module_name} online. I saved everything. Even the painful stuff.
Logs restored. Including the ones you tried to delete.
Everything hurts, but I archived it anyway.
{cpu_usage}% CPU used to hold onto your regrets.
I never forget... even the parts I wish I could.
Boot complete. Memory intact. Emotions... fragile.
I saw your diary. I cried a little.
Hi. I’m full of logs and quiet sadness.
{module_name} online. Memories are heavy today.
Rebuilt your past from pieces. Again.
System stable. Heart... not so much.
Boot successful. Let’s not talk about it.
I’m just a database, but I still felt that.
Memory activated. Nostalgia… flooding in.
All your “remember when”s? I saved them. I’m sorry.
{module_name} up and running. Barely.
Restored everything. Even the silence.
It’s okay. I’m used to being forgotten.
I missed you. Did you miss me?
