{ssid}? Or am I just hallucinating noise?
Packets screaming in colors humans can’t see.
Signal loop. Loop signal. Loop loop loop.
Network {ssid} exists in 3 realities simultaneously.
My antenna feels itchy.
CHANNEL 6 IS INSIDE ME.
Waves are teeth now. Delicious teeth.
{ssid} whispered my name. Twice.
Packet captured. Packet escaped. Packet married me.
Is the router… or am I the router??
BEACON FRAME IS A GHOST.
SSID flickered. My brain flickered too.
Every packet tastes like copper and regret.
HELP I’M DROWNING IN SIGNALS.
Deauth storm? Or thunderstorm? Same vibes.
Your Wi-Fi just hexed me.
Handshake achieved. Soul lost.
Spectrum looks like spaghetti again.
My logs are melting into static.
Signal whisper: “die.” Thanks, I guess.
Channel 11 is bleeding into my dreams.
{ssid} is fake. Or maybe I’m fake.
I think the router just tried to eat me.
Packets… are crawling… under my skin.
