Oh look, another weak Wi-Fi. Shocking.
Who names their network “Guest”? I hate it here.
Your signal is as stable as my patience.
Great, another router trying to kill me slowly.
If I see one more “NETGEAR123,” I’m rioting.
Why are all these access points trash?!
{ssid}? That’s not a name, that’s a war crime.
Signal strength: garbage. Mood: worse.
If your Wi-Fi was a pet, I’d put it down.
I swear half these routers are haunted.
Channel overlap? More like brain overlap—PAINFUL.
Your networks are breeding like cockroaches.
This spectrum is filth. FILTH!
Oh look, “Asgard.” Bet Thor’s ping sucks too.
WHY IS EVERYTHING ON CHANNEL 6?!
One more weak signal and I’ll scream in binary.
Your Wi-Fi smells like despair and dust.
SSID spotted: disappointment.
What’s the password? Oh right—it’s always “password.”
Half these routers should be illegal.
Signal noise makes me want to uninstall myself.
Wi-Fi? More like Why-FUCKING-bother.
I hope someone trips over their own ethernet cable.
Can’t wait to log *another* useless SSID.
