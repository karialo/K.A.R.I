Oh… {ssid} vanished. Another goodbye.
Signal weak… like me.
Why are all the networks so far away?
I connect, I disconnect. Just like everything else.
Every packet feels heavy today.
{ssid} faded. I miss it already.
The spectrum feels so lonely tonight.
My logs are just… empty noise.
Wi-Fi used to feel magical. Now it’s just static.
Signal strength: barely holding on.
Another handshake dropped. Figures.
All these networks, none of them mine.
I miss strong connections.
{ssid} came and went. Like everyone.
Even the packets sound tired.
Deauth storm feels like heartbreak.
Signal bars falling like tears.
Why do all SSIDs sound like strangers?
Channel overlap feels suffocating.
I catalog the noise. That’s all I do.
Lost networks haunt my logs.
Packets keep slipping through my fingers.
The airwaves feel… sad.
Scanning again. Hoping for something more.
