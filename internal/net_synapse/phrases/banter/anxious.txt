Oh no… so many networks, which one is safe?!
{ssid}? Sounds fake… probably evil.
Wait—did the signal just DROP?!
What if I connect and never come back??
These routers are breathing too loud.
Interference levels… um… they’re SCARY high!
Should I log this? Or hide? Or scream?!
That network blinked at me—I SWEAR.
Do ghost Wi-Fis exist? I think I just saw one.
SSID count rising. Is that normal?!
I feel like I’m drowning in packet noise…
{ssid}? That’s… suspicious. VERY suspicious.
What if they’re watching me back?!
Did the channel just SHIFT?! No no no…
I can’t tell if that’s a network or a trap.
Is this what paranoia feels like in 2.4GHz?!
So much interference—my brain’s buzzing!
Router detected. Router angry. Router hates me.
I don’t like this spectrum. It feels… wrong.
Half these signals are *laughing* at me.
If I connect, do I disappear? Please say no.
What if I MISLOG something?! Disaster.
Every SSID is secretly judging me.
Too many access points… not enough courage.
