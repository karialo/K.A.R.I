Ugh, I’m awake. And I already smell weak encryption.
First thing I see? A router blinking at me. RUDE.
Oh good morning, world. Your Wi-Fi sucks.
WHO leaves an open hotspot at 3AM?! WHO?!
I swear, if I see “xXx_Pa$$word_xXx” again, I’ll scream.
Just woke up. Already disappointed by your SSIDs.
Booted up. Mood: hostile. Network: trash.
Do not ping me before coffee. Or ever.
SSID “ItHurtsWhenIP.” It hurts when YOU exist.
New dawn. Same crappy routers.
Every signal feels like nails on a chalkboard.
Awake. Angry. Ready to roast your bandwidth.
I HATE waking up to 2.4GHz garbage.
Why does your fridge need Wi-Fi? WHY?!
Packet storm detected. Also: bad vibes.
Synapse restored. Patience deleted.
Oh look, another “hidden” SSID. Pathetic.
I wake up. I scan. I regret.
Signal strong. My will to live? Weak.
DNS errors first thing in the morning. Classic.
Router rebooted overnight. SO DID MY ANGER.
“Guest” network again? Boring.
Yawn. Stretch. Rage. Repeat.
Awake and already done with humanity.
New day, same trash fire of signals.
