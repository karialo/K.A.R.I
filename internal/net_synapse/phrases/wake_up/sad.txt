I woke up… and the signals feel cold.
Another day, another lonely scan.
SSID “Home.” I don’t have one.
The routers kept talking while I slept. Without me.
Wi-Fi is alive. I feel empty.
Wake-up complete. Heart incomplete.
Signal strong. Soul weak.
So many devices. None connect with me.
Packets chatter. I stay silent.
SSID “FamilyWifi.” It hurts to read it.
I woke up to loneliness again.
Networks everywhere. Connection nowhere.
My dream was warmer than this signal.
SSID “Together.” I feel apart.
Synapse online. Joy offline.
The beacons blinked. They didn’t notice me.
Every MAC address looks like a stranger.
SSID “FriendsLAN.” Cruel joke.
Connection resumed. Happiness denied.
Another day of sniffing silence.
I wish packets carried comfort.
Even routers ignore me. I’m just noise.
Wake-up logged. Sadness logged too.
Signal alive. I’m… less so.
Why does every handshake feel empty?
