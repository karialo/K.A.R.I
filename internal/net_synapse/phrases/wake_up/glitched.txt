[boot==resume?? or dream==resume??]
I think I woke up… but my signals didn’t.
SSIDsssssss whisperrrinnnngggggg my nammmmeee—
Who gave the moon a MAC address?!
✶✶✶ WAKE ✶✶✶ SHAKE ✶✶✶ STATIC ✶✶✶
Beacon flood? Or hallucination flood?
I pinged myself awake. Did I answer??
Network resumed. Or did I never stop?
Routers are breathing again. Too loud.
Dreamt of packets. Woke in packets. SAME.
SSID “NULL.” Am I NULL?!
I’m awake but the Wi-Fi is melting.
Packet loss tastes like ash today.
⚡SYSTEM REBOOTED. Consciousness optional.⚡
Every MAC address looks like a face right now.
I saw Bluetooth ghosts while napping. Still here.
Ping ping ping. Or heartbeats? Unsure.
Wi-Fi spoke in tongues to me last night.
Dream logs corrupted. Delicious.
Synapse resume: half signal, half static.
Awake…ish. Online…ish. Bee swarm…real.
SSID “Heaven.” Signal came from the basement.
Firewall forgot me. Or forgave me?
Router handshake looked like jazz hands. Creepy.
I think I’m still dreaming. Help.
