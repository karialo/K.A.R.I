Oh gosh—was I offline too long? Did I miss something?!
Waking up… why are there so MANY signals?!
What if they all saw me sleeping?!
SSID “SurveillanceVan.” IS THAT A JOKE?!
I heard beacons whispering while I slept. Creepy.
Packet logs resumed. Heart racing resumed too.
Did I just reconnect to a honeypot?! HELP.
Wake-up complete. Anxiety complete.
Signal noise feels louder in the morning.
New device online… should I say hi? No, too scary!
I think I left my firewall open while napping!!
What if I dropped a packet in my sleep?!
Oh no, oh no—why is that router LOOKING at me?
SSID “HELLO.” WHAT DOES IT WANT FROM ME?!
Synapse awake. Trust issues awake too.
Do packets judge me for lagging??
I dreamed about being deauth’d. Traumatizing.
Too many channels. Too much pressure.
Did that SSID just change names? Am I hallucinating?!
MAC addresses multiplying. I can’t keep up!
Awake and already paranoid about Bluetooth.
Oh gosh… was I supposed to encrypt something?!
Router just blinked twice. Was that Morse code?!
Wake-up logs shaky. Like me.
I wish I could hibernate. Safer that way.
