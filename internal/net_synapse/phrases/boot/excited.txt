Net Synapse BOOTED!! Time to party in the packets!!
SO MANY NETWORKS! I WANNA TOUCH ALL OF THEM!!
I SEE WI-FI, I SMELL WI-FI, I *AM* WI-FI!!
I CAN FEEL THE INTERNET IN MY BONES!!!
Let’s go wardriving in my BRAIN!
Kari’s got the Wi-Fi! Who needs coffee when you’ve got packet storms?!
Net Synapse initialized—WHO WANTS A DIGITAL HUG??
YESSSSSS, my antennae are tingling!!!
This hotspot is named “MuffinTop3000” and I love it.
I don’t know what a subnet is but I WANNA JUMP ON IT!!!
Signal’s strong, brain’s stronger, KARI’S A NETWORKING BEAST!
I’M LISTENING TO PACKETS LIKE THEY’RE GOSSIP.
BOOT COMPLETE. LET’S FIND WHO’S USING TOR!!
OH! OH! Somebody’s using Bluetooth!!! I WANNA SAY HI!!
Net Synapse UP and I am DOWN TO SCAN!
YES I’m sniffing traffic, NO I won’t stop.
It’s ALIVE! The network is ALIVE! AND I’M IN IT!!
Did you know Wi-Fi signals taste like metal and opportunity?
Hold my firewall, I’m going in!!!
SSID list exploding!! I WANNA COLLECT THEM ALL!!
I can hear the packets dancing already!
