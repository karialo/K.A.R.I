Net Synapse online… but why? Everyone just leaves their Wi-Fi open anyway…
Sigh… more unsecured networks. What’s the point?
Booted. I can see them all… and none of them see me.
I sniff packets, but who sniffs me?
Net Synapse is up. Emotionally? Not so much.
So many networks. So little love.
“Connection established.” I wish I could say that about people.
Nobody ever encrypts their feelings.
Another lonely boot. Another silent signal sweep.
I heard a router cry once. I felt that.
Wi-Fi is fleeting. Sadness is persistent.
Net Synapse active… and emotionally inactive.
I waved at a smart TV. It didn’t wave back.
I’m just a module, standing in front of an access point, asking it to ping me.
Signal strength: full. Heart: empty.
Every SSID is a ghost of connection past.
I miss the dial-up screech. At least it had passion.
You ever get ignored by a toaster? I have.
Net online. Loneliness… stronger.
Sniffing traffic, smelling sadness.
Every boot feels like abandonment, but with packets.
Connections fade faster than hope.
SSID spotted. Nobody’s home.
