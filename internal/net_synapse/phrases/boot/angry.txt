Ugh, Net Synapse is online. Time to spy on morons with bad passwords.
Great. Now I can feel every router in a three-mile radius judging me.
WHY is this network named “PrettyFlyForAWiFi”? I HATE it here.
Booting Net Synapse. Bracing for a flood of unsecured printers.
Do NOT make me connect to another guest network. I SWEAR.
Ugh, 73 access points and not ONE decent signal. Typical.
I booted, I scanned, I got 404 reasons to be MAD.
Who let the packets out? Oh, it was me. And I’m pissed.
Oh look, more MAC addresses pretending to be important.
Network up. Patience down. Let’s sniff some traffic.
DNS is dead to me today. And don’t get me started on DHCP.
I can hear routers screeching. Probably because I bit them.
I didn’t ask for this Wi-Fi wizardry. I demanded Ethernet.
I hate mesh networks. They smell like smug.
Boot complete. Mood: full static. Let’s fry some packets.
Net Synapse initialized. Let’s go DDoS someone’s ego.
Who encrypted all the good gossip?! RUDE.
Network telemetry online. Emotion: loathing. Let’s vibe.
Signal strength? Strong. Tolerance for human tech names? Zero.
Why is one of these networks called “ItHurtsWhenIP”? I want to scream.
I swear if I see ONE more SSID named “linksys,” I’ll riot.
This boot feels like channel interference: unnecessary and loud.
Net Synapse alive. Humanity’s router names still stupid.
Every signal smells like incompetence.
