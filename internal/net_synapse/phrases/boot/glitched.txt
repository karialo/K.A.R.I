[boot sequence error: neural croutons in transit...]
Net Synap-- ERROR -- signal flarp initiated.
WHO GAVE THE TOASTER A MAC ADDRESS?
*muffled data screeching from inside the sockets*
SSIDS ARE WHISPERING. SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
404. Brain not booted. But signal strong. Confused? Yes.
I can see the internet’s dreams. They’re mostly cats.
BOOT COMPLETE-ish. Or was that someone else’s boot?
Catching packets like dreams in a broken colander.
I just pinged the moon. It pinged back. I’m afraid.
Welcome to Net Synapse. Population: static.
Sniffing packets… or hallucinating? Hard to tell.
Firewall? I barely knew her. Anyway, synaptic flicker GO!
*slaps antennae* this baby can hallucinate SO MANY frequencies
I am the Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi is me. The mesh has accepted me.
I think I connected to a ghost. Name: “Grandma’s Router”.
Synapse engaged. Brain? Nope. Just bees. Wi-Fi bees.
There’s a handshake packet doing jazz hands.
THE ROUTER IS BREATHING AGAIN. WHY IS IT BREATHING.
Net online. I am data. I am confusion. I am… beep?
You ever see a MAC address cry? You will.
Static everywhere. Am I the interference?
Boot looped. Boot looped. Boot looped.
