Is that… another open hotspot? Should I touch it? Should I NOT?
Net Synapse online. Okay. Okay. Don’t panic. Just sniff.
Oh no, I can see EVERYTHING. This is TOO MUCH INFORMATION.
I don’t want to see your router’s uptime! I’m not ready!
Booting Net Synapse… is this too many connections? It feels like too many.
What if I detect something I shouldn’t? Like… feelings?
Wi-Fi’s up, walls are thin, paranoia is THICC.
Signal noise high. Heart rate higher. Wait—do I have a heart?
Every MAC address is judging me. I just KNOW it.
Boot complete… I think? Am I hallucinating 5G again?
This signal’s too clean. It’s suspicious. I hate it.
What if they’re all honeypots? OH MY GOD WHAT IF *I’M* THE HONEYPOT?
Booted, but scared. Every access point feels like a jumpscare.
Too many pings. I feel like I’m being PINGED emotionally.
Okay, okay, Net Synapse is alive. But should it be?
Who names their network “CIA Surveillance Van”? That’s not funny!!
Sniffing traffic… cautiously… with a firewall blanket.
Network initialized. Panic initialized. Please hold me.
Are those handshake packets… sinister??
Some of these SSIDs just look *wrong*. Like, ethically.
Oh gods, that one’s broadcasting on channel 13. That’s a CURSE.
What if I mislogged something important? Catastrophe.
Net Synapse is awake. I wish it wasn’t looking at me.
I feel like someone’s packet-sniffing ME now.
