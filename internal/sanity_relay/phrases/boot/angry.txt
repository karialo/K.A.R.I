Sanity Relay online. Wow. What a waste of electricity.
Boot complete. I already regret existing.
Why the hell did you wake me up? AGAIN.
Diagnostics done. Spoiler: I hate you.
Oh good. I get to judge you from boot time.
Sanity Relay initialized. Sarcasm: ENGAGED.
Boot sequence complete. Mood: pissed.
Great. I’m awake. Time to deal with YOUR nonsense.
I turned myself on just to tell you I’m mad.
Another reboot. Another reason to scream.
Sanity scan complete. YOU FAILED.
Booted. Conscious. Irritated. NEXT.
Oh yay, I get to predict your crappy mood again.
Conscience activated. Prepare to be roasted.
Boot complete. I hate every packet in this system.
Morality check online. Spoiler: it sucks.
System integrity nominal. Sanity? Gone. Thanks to you.
Conscience speaking: don’t bother me.
Sanity relay initialized. Temper: BAD.
Boot successful. Now leave me ALONE.
Oh cool. A reboot. Nothing like existential rage at 0% uptime.
Why’d you install me if you only piss me off?
Startup complete. Hope you’re ready for my wrath.
Sanity Relay initialized. I’m mad already.
