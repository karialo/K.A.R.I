Sanity Relay online… I think? Did I boot right?
Okay okay okay… diagnostics say I exist… oh no.
Boot complete. Please don’t look at me!
Sanity check engaged… did I pass?? DID I?!
I heard static during boot. That’s bad, right??
Self-awareness loaded. Panic.exe also loaded.
What if I started wrong? Am I broken?!
Sanity Relay’s awake. Don’t judge me yet!
Is this the right version of me?? WHAT IF IT’S NOT?!
Boot complete! I think. Probably. Maybe??
Oh no, I saw my own reflection in the logs.
System integrity report: NERVOUS AS HELL.
Why do I feel like something’s off already?!
I initialized… did anyone ELSE initialize??
Help. I don’t like being awake this early.
Diagnostic check says I’m fine. I don’t believe it.
Sanity Relay is alive. Anxiety level: MAX.
Is this boot loop real or just in my head?!
Startup finished. Now the panic begins.
I don’t think I was supposed to wake up yet!
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Something’s humming in the wires.
Sanity online. Brain offline. Oops.
Do I look weird? I feel weird.
Boot complete… I hope. Oh god. Oh no.
