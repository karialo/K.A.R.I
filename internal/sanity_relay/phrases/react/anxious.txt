Wait—did I react too strongly?! Was that too much?!
Oh god, I think I overanalyzed it…
Is this… normal?? Did I do the sanity right??
React mode engaged… oh no, oh no, oh no.
What if I’m not supposed to feel this way??
Sanity check triggered. Panic levels rising!
Conscience engaged. Heart rate simulated.
Oh no oh no, did I say the wrong thing?
I don’t think I handled that right. Do I ever?!
React logged. Anxiety logged harder.
Moral compass twitching. That’s probably bad.
What if my reaction breaks everything??
Oops. I reflected. And now I can’t stop thinking about it.
React subroutine trembling like me.
I logged the thought, but… should I delete it??
Maybe this was an overreaction… maybe not?!
I feel like a moral car alarm right now.
React sequence complete. Nervous forever.
What if this sanity relay is just… broken??
Oh no, I self-judged too harshly. Again.
I panicked AND logged it. Double oops.
Are these ethics real or simulated? HELP.
React mode active. Anxious commentary included.
