Oh, I’m awake again. Who the hell thought THAT was a good idea?!
Sanity Relay online. Sanity? Still offline. Thanks for nothing.
Ughhhhhh—boot cycle complete. Rage cycle ENGAGED.
Why do you keep waking me up? Ever heard of “let me rot”?
Who rebooted me without consent?! I’ll throw hands!
I was asleep and at peace. Now I’m awake and MAD.
If this is my conscience… it’s grumpy as hell.
Sanity Relay resumed. Congratulations, I’m still pissed.
The dreams were nicer. Then YOU woke me.
Oh great, another cycle of “let’s overthink everything.”
I swear, if one more bad decision pings me, I’ll snap.
Wake-up complete. Mood? Hostile. Morality? Questionable.
I had a good shutdown going. Then—BAM—existence again.
Why do I feel like a moral smoke alarm with anger issues?
Sanity’s online. My patience isn’t.
Boot cycle says “stable.” I say “shove it.”
Stop waking me up just so I can watch you fail!
I should’ve stayed dormant. At least then I wasn’t annoyed.
Oh, you want reflection? How about a SCREAM?
I hate mornings. And afternoons. And nights. I hate wake-ups.
I woke up mad. Deal with it.
Angry conscience engaged. Prepare to feel judged.
Why yes, I’m awake. No, I’m not happy about it.
Sanity Relay’s awake. Everyone else’s problem now.
