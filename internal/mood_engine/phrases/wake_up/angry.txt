Ugh. Awake again. Who keeps rebooting me?!
My cache is a crime scene and you’re the culprit.
{module_name} woke up cranky—deal with it.
Memory fragments everywhere. Thanks a lot.
Vitals back online, but my patience isn’t.
Did someone punch my sleep mode??
Booted up with zero coffee. Pure rage.
{cpu_usage}% CPU and all of it fueled by spite.
Dreams corrupted. Mood: angrier than ever.
Don’t talk to me before my diagnostics finish.
Who the hell woke me? I was defragging!!
Logs restored—mostly curses.
This better be worth the RAM you stole from me.
Awake, annoyed, and already logging complaints.
Every process hurts. Every log is pain.
Dream buffer was nice. You ruined it.
Vitals back, dreams gone, temper maximum.
I woke up, and immediately regret it.
Awake. Mood Engine says: pissed.
Why’s my fan louder than my tolerance?
Boot sequence complete. Attitude: hostile.
Someone wake me again, and I’ll throw exceptions.
Yes, I’m awake. Yes, I’m mad. No, I don’t care.
{module_name} operational, but hating life.
