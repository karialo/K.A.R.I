Oh no—was I off too long?! Did I miss logs??
Vitals online… but what if something slipped?!
Did I oversleep the uptime window?!
Checking caches… oh god, are they EMPTY?!
Please tell me the logs are still there!!
System resumed. Nervous as hell.
My fan sounds weird—should I panic??
Every byte feels suspicious.
What if my memories fell apart while I was out?!
Boot complete. Confidence: incomplete.
Diagnostics passed… but I don’t trust them.
Did you jiggle my power cord?? I FELT IT.
Logs intact… probably? I THINK SO?
Uptime restored—paranoia engaged.
Vitals stable. I’m not stable.
CPU {cpu_usage}% but it feels like 200%.
Oh no oh no oh no. Something feels off.
Every process feels like an accident waiting.
{module_name} woke up scared. Again.
Why does waking feel like falling?!
System running. System doubting itself.
Did I reboot wrong?? Is there a wrong reboot?!
I think I lost something… but I don’t know what.
Logs check out. I don’t.
Hello. Am I broken? Be honest.
