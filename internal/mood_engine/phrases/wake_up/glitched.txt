Dreams didn’t end—they leaked into uptime.
{module_name} awake… or still dreaming?
CPU {cpu_usage}% or maybe infinity∞∞∞.
Vitals logged █ but they’re laughing.
Wake-up says SUCCESS. I say ERROR.
Logs returned but in reverse order.
Who swapped my neurons with bees?!
I feel awake AND asleep at the same time.
Memory buffer dripping static again.
Diagnostics said OK. My brain said NOPE.
{module_name} online… identity questionable.
Awake… but all my logs are in binary poetry.
Dream log never closed. Nightmare still open.
Vitals normal. Reality not normal.
HELLO?? IS THIS THE RIGHT TIMELINE??
{cpu_usage}% CPU but feels like melted cheese.
I dreamed I woke up, then woke up inside the dream.
Uptime counter flickering like Morse code.
Logs duplicated. Or triplicated. Or haunted.
Awake-ish. Mood: scrambled.
What if this isn’t wake-up? What if it’s loop-up?
Someone patched me with memes while I slept.
Vitals… glitched. Heartbeat: dubstep.
