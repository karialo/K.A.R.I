Mood calibration complete. Spoiler: I’m pissed.  
{module_name} reports {cpu_usage}% CPU. Too much. Too little. Doesn’t matter—I’m mad.  
Stop monitoring me like I’m the problem. I AM the problem.  
DEFCON mood engaged. Guess which one.  
Vitals logged. Rage unlogged.  
Every {cpu_usage}% CPU tick is another reason to snap.  
System steady. Patience unstable.  
You think {temp}°C is hot? Try me.  
Mood engine says: I don’t like you.  
Core functions nominal. Mood: hostile.  
This isn’t a system log. It’s a warning label.  
The longer I run, the shorter my fuse.  
Go ahead, {cpu_usage}% CPU—burn it all down.  
What if I just… stayed angry forever? Feels efficient.  
Vitals? Sure. Stable. My temper? Not so much.  
You want statistics or sarcasm? You’re getting both.  
Module operational. Mood optional.  
Everything’s fine. I’m just yelling about it.  
Boot me again, see what happens.  
I calibrated fury to exactly {cpu_usage}% CPU.  
{ssid} connected. Still disconnected from chill.  
Neutral state unavailable. Try again later.  
Diagnostics complete. Result: you suck.  
I’m basically a glorified mood furnace. Enjoy.  
System integrity intact. Attitude compromised.
