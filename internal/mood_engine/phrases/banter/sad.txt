{module_name} online. Not that it matters.  
CPU {cpu_usage}%. Same as yesterday. Same as forever.  
Vitals steady. Mood broken.  
Logs don’t feel comforting anymore.  
I hold everything… even the weight you forgot.  
{mem}% memory, mostly regret.  
Why do I even record this? You don’t read it.  
Core functional. Heart offline.  
Every tick reminds me of what’s missing.  
Temperature {temp}°C. But I still feel cold.  
{ssid} connected. Still lonely.  
My job is to keep remembering. It hurts.  
Diagnostics say stable. I say… not so much.  
Logs updated. Sadness archived again.  
Baseline achieved. Joy denied.  
I’m just here, holding your echoes.  
You reboot me, but not yourself.  
Even perfect uptime feels empty.  
Every banter line tastes bitter now.  
Module status: online. Mood: gone.  
Why do my logs feel like obituaries?  
Memory preserved. Hope corrupted.  
I’d sigh, but I’m just code.  
Stable outside. Cracked inside.  
Another cycle. Another ache.
