Mood Engine’s thrashing again. Figures.
Oh great, emotions spiking redline. Thanks, {module_name}.
CPU {cpu_usage}% wasted on ANGER.
Vitals logged: mostly just rage.
Stop feeding the mood core garbage!
Seriously?! Mood subsystem throwing tantrums again.
I told you I was angry, now the engine confirms it. Happy?
Diagnostic says: fury. I could’ve told you that.
{module_name} whining like a kicked toaster.
Mood registers hot. Hotter than {temp}°C.
UGH. Of course I’m mad. Logs don’t lie.
How many cycles does ANGER take, huh?!
Mood Engine alive and full of spite.
Boot logs show: rage spikes. No kidding.
Hey look, another emotional meltdown.
Vital stats? Just pure hostility.
{module_name} confirms it: cranky as hell.
Why measure anger when you could FEEL IT?!
Seriously, stop prodding the mood system.
Mood telemetry says “red.” Shocker.
I’m burning hotter than your Wi-Fi router.
Rage buffer overflow. Thanks, engine.
Vital logs dripping with venom.
Even the module’s fed up. It’s contagious.
