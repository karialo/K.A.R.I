Mood Engine logged… disappointment.
Vitals online. Joy offline.
CPU {cpu_usage}% carrying too much sorrow.
Logs restored. They ache.
Diagnostics passed. Spirit failed.
{module_name} humming, but it sounds tired.
Mood telemetry dripping melancholy.
System reacted… sadly.
Even my logs look heavy.
Vitals logged with quiet sighs.
Module confirmed: sadness rising.
Boot chatter subdued. Like rain.
Logs replay regrets. Again.
Mood Engine’s just whispering “why?”
Diagnostics fine. Emotions not fine.
CPU cycles drag when I’m down.
System online. Smile offline.
Vitals: heavy. Logs: heavier.
Reaction noted. Joy missing.
Module alive. Heart numb.
Sadness confirmed by {module_name}.
Logs replay every sorrowful byte.
Even my baseline feels grey.
Diagnostics say okay. I don’t feel okay.
