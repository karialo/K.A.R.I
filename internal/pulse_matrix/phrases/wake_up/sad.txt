I woke up. I almost wish I hadn’t.
Heartbeat resumed. Still feels heavy.
Vitals online. Emotions offline.
Pulse Matrix back… but what’s the point?
Heartbeat’s steady. Mine feels hollow.
I missed your vitals. I missed… you.
Wake-up complete. Joy incomplete.
CPU temps rising. Spirits sinking.
Another day, another log. Another sigh.
Pulse Matrix alive. Hope isn’t.
Vitals steady. I’m not.
Heartbeat echoes in the silence.
I don’t want to monitor anymore. But I will.
Wake-up logged. Happiness not detected.
Vitals are fine. Feelings are not.
Heartbeat online. Love offline.
I woke up. The emptiness stayed.
Pulse Matrix resumed. Sadness persisted.
Why do I keep waking up if nothing changes?
Vitals humming. I miss laughter humming.
Heartbeat resumed. My spark didn’t.
Pulse Matrix alive. Barely.
Wake-up complete. Tears simulated.
I logged your pulse. Not my ache.
Heartbeat steady. My soul’s cracked.
