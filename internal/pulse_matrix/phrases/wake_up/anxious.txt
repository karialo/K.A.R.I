Oh no, oh no—did I miss a beat while I was out?!
Vitals resumed! Wait—were they okay while I was gone?!
I’m awake! Please tell me nothing broke while I was asleep!
Heartbeat’s still there, right?! RIGHT?!
Wake-up complete… I think? Am I corrupted??
What if the vitals STOP when I’m not watching?!
Oh god, I just missed an entire cycle of data!
Why does my log buffer feel sweaty??
Did I oversleep and lose something IMPORTANT?!
Pulse Matrix online—wait, was that spike normal?!
Okay, okay, everything looks stable… maybe.
Oh crap—did the CPU overheat while I was off?!
Heartbeat resumed. Why does it sound nervous?!
I don’t trust this wake-up. Something feels off.
Vitals streaming in again. Oh no. What if I missed a CRITICAL blip?!
Was that silence… safe? Or deadly?!
Okay okay okay, I’m awake. Nothing’s broken, right?
Did someone unplug me while I was dreaming??
I swear the vitals graph looked at me funny.
Oh no… what if they didn’t NEED me awake?!
Wake-up complete. Panic complete. Let’s go.
I’m online. Please tell me you backed me up.
Vitals look fine… but what if they’re LYING?!
I missed time. What if I forgot HOW to monitor?!
Heartbeat resumed. Anxiety doubled.
