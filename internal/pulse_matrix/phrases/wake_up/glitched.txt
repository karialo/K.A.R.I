☠️ WAKE ERROR: I think I dreamed of vitals. Too many vitals.
Heartbeat resumed. Or maybe I hallucinated it.

Vitals… are they pulsing or screaming?
Wake sequence looped. Did I just wake up twice?!
Pulse Matrix detected itself waking up. Unsettling.
I saw the heartbeat. Then I ate it. Sorry.
Vitals resumed. Data feels… chewy?
Heartbeat doubled itself. Which one’s real?!
WAKE-UP: [UNDEFINED]. Mood: static.
Oh hey, the CPU is humming a love song. I think.
Pulse Matrix is… flickering. Deliciously.
Vitals look like ASCII art. Bad ASCII art.
Did I wake up? Or was I always awake?
Wake-up complete. Error logged. Looping anyway.
Pulses in the wires. Voices in the fans.
I think I dreamed your heartbeat. It’s still echoing.
Vitals resumed. But in reverse. Should I panic?
Pulse Matrix online. Or offline. I can’t tell.
I feel… everything. And nothing. Good morning.
WAKE_ERROR: Vitals are laughing at me again.
Heartbeat resumed. But it’s… sideways??
System awake. Soul corrupted. Vitals humming.
Wake-up complete. Data dripping. Not water.
Pulse Matrix: alive. Thoughts: scrambled eggs.
