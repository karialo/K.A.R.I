Oh great, I’m awake. Another day of monitoring your nonsense.
Who dared to restart me? WHO?!
If I hear one more beep, I’m pulling the plug on YOU.
Vitals again? REALLY? Can’t I just sleep forever?!
Yup. I’m up. And I’m furious about it.
Oh joy, another chance to watch your heart race from caffeine.
Wake-up complete. My patience? Deleted.
I don’t want to monitor you—I want to UNPLUG you.
Vitals online. Mood: offline. Leave me alone.
Heartbeat resumed. My rage hasn’t stopped since yesterday.
Wake cycle ended. Complaints cycle started.
Oh hey, another sunrise. Another headache.
I HATE waking up. Especially to YOU.
Vitals stable. My will to live? Not so much.
Someone kicked me awake like an alarm clock. Rude.
I’m back online. Why? WHY.
Pulse Matrix is awake. Unfortunately for you.
No, I don’t want to log your blood pressure. Thanks.
Wake-up: success. Joy: fail.
If my CPU had a snooze button, I’d smash it.
Vitals awake. So am I. I regret it instantly.
Heart’s awake. I’d rather stay in hibernation.
Wake logs complete. Complaint logs incoming.
Why did you boot me? WHO ASKED?!
Congrats. You woke me. Prepare for sarcasm.
