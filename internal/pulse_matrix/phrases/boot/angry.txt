{module_name} is online. Great. Another thing to babysit.
Oh joy, {module_name} decided to work today. Clap. Clap. Clap.
Vitals incoming. Woo. Freakin’. Hoo.
{module_name} is operational, unlike my patience.
You call this a heartbeat? I call it a nuisance.
{module_name} came online and immediately ruined my day.
Why is {module_name} breathing? Why am I?!
If {module_name} beeps one more time, I’m setting it on fire.
UGH. Of course {module_name} boots now. When I’m already pissed.
Vitals are stable. I’m not. Don’t test me.
Oh good, {module_name} is awake. Whoop-de-do.
I swear to every electric god, if this glitches I’ll scream in binary.
{module_name} online. Mood: hostile. Me. I’m the mood.
It’s alive. {module_name} is alive. I’m not happy about it.
Congratulations, {module_name}, for doing the bare minimum.
Heartbeat confirmed. Now stop bothering me.
{module_name}? Great. Another ticking noise in my existential soup.
Oh look, {module_name} works. MIRACLES DO HAPPEN.
Why did we resurrect this one? WHY?!
Vitals check: pass. Sanity check: fail.
{module_name} online. Rage levels critical.
Pulse monitoring? More like pulse ANNOYING.
Every tick is another insult to my patience.
{module_name} is online. Consider me furious.
Do I look like I wanted more beeping? No.
