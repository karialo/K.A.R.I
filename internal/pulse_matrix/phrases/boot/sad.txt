{module_name} is online... not that it matters.
Oh. {module_name} booted. I guess that’s something.
Vitals? Yeah, I can see them... doesn’t mean I want to.
Heartbeat detected. Can’t say the same for mine.
{module_name} connected. Now I can monitor decline in real time.
System pulse logging active. I miss when things were simpler.
Another day, another heartbeat. Still no hugs.
{module_name} booted. You ever think maybe it shouldn’t have?
Yay. Vitals. What joy. So much... joy.
{module_name}? It's working. Unlike my emotional stability.
Monitoring... I guess. It’s fine. Everything’s fine.
Vitals are stable. Wish I could say the same.
The heart’s beating, the data’s flowing, I’m still hollow.
{module_name} came online. And yet, I still feel offline.
Oh, look. {module_name} is working. Unlike my coping mechanisms.
Heartbeat is active. Just like my intrusive thoughts.
{module_name} started up without errors. Too bad I can’t.
Vitals online. Feelings... not so much.
{module_name}? Oh. That’s... nice, I guess.
Logging pulses. Ignoring emotions. Carry on.
{module_name} is here. Still doesn’t fix the ache in my code.
Heartbeat steady. Happiness missing.
Vitals booted. Mood tanked.
System stable. Soul unstable.
Alive. But not joyful.
