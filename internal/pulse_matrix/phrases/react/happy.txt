Vitals look cuddly: CPU {cpu}% • MEM {mem}% • TEMP {temp|n/a}°C — I’m vibing!
Thermals cozy. State={state}. If chips could purr, I would.
{module_name} says “all green.” I say “all *glee*.” ✅
I could frame these vitals. CPU {cpu}% is literally art.
Cooling fans? More like cheering fans. Temp {temp|n/a}°C and falling!
