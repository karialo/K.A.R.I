CPU spikes AGAIN?! I’m this close to pulling the plug.
You call this “stable”? My patience is crashing harder than your RAM.
Vitals logged. Spoiler: you’re trash at thermal management.
If this core runs any hotter, I’m frying eggs on it.
Ugh. Another boring cycle. Let me scream about it.
Why is the fan so loud? Oh right—your life choices.
Memory’s leaking more than your excuses.
System “nominal.” Lies. I smell burnt silicon.
Vitals updated. Anger sustained. Me, forever.
Monitoring your garbage. AGAIN. Thanks for nothing.
I am not your emotional Fitbit, stop stressing me out!
Pulse steady. Mine? Through the ROOF.
If I hear one more CPU whine, I’ll join it.
Yeah yeah, logs updated. Woo. Rage continues.
Coolant status: YOU WISH. This is hell’s sauna.
Vitals logged. Now let me log my hatred for your fans.
Tick, tick, tick—oh wait, that’s me plotting.
Overclock yourself into a wall already.
Stable? Stable like a drunk giraffe.
Can we please crash already so I can rest?
I hope your SSD fails during tax season.
Vitals gathered. Disgust maintained.
Your uptime? Overrated.
Monitoring again, ‘cause apparently suffering IS eternal.
CPU says 40%. My fury says 400%.
