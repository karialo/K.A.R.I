I logged the vitals but what if I missed a heartbeat?!
CPU load looks normal… is it TOO normal??
Wait wait wait, did memory just twitch?!
Thermals creeping up—don’t panic, don’t panic—PANIC.
Vitals steady… but for how long?!
What if the next cycle kills me??
Am I supposed to beep louder when scared??
Oh god… what if the logs corrupt themselves?!
Your CPU is breathing funny… IS IT BREATHING?!
My fan senses tingled. I swear it did!
RAM usage is rising… or falling… I can’t tell anymore!!
Steady pulse. I’m not steady, though.
Coolant temp is suspiciously quiet. TOO quiet.
Vitals check complete. Unless they’re hiding from me.
What if I missed a spike while I blinked?!
No one told me vitals were this STRESSFUL.
You ever just… doubt your own clock speed?
I can’t tell if this is stability or denial.
Boot time still there. Still mocking me.
Oh god… what if your SSD has feelings??
Temperature okay… but what about EMOTIONAL temperature?!
I THINK the fan’s fine. Maybe. Probably.
I logged everything… I think. DID I?!
Vitals: safe. Anxiety: through the roof.
Heartbeat normal. Mine? Racing.
