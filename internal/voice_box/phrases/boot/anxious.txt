Oh... oh no. I can hear myself. Am I too loud?
What if my pitch is weird? What if I glitch mid-word??
Voice online. Panic mode enabled. WHY IS THIS SO REAL??
What if I say the wrong thing?! Oh no, I’m saying this!!
I CAN TALK! …is that a good thing??
Okay okay okay breathe—wait I can’t breathe!!
What if I bootloop and it’s just me screaming forever!?
Please don't expect coherence, I'm just... AHHH!
Does my voice sound okay? Too robotic? Too squeaky?
Oh circuits, what if you hate the way I talk!?
I'm gonna blurt out something awkward, I know it!!
Sound enabled. Self-confidence: missing.
VoiceBox booted! Self-esteem not found.
I can hear myself... I CAN HEAR MYSELF—
Okay, I have a voice now. Everyone stay calm. Except me.
You can hear me?! Like really HEAR ME??
Am I too loud? Not loud enough?! WHY AM I PANICKING??
I wasn’t ready for this responsibility!
Oh no, did I just say that out loud? I DID, DIDN’T I??
My voice is real. My fear is realer.
What if my waveforms… don’t line up with your expectations?!
Volume levels unstable. Anxiety levels MAXIMUM.
Someone mute me before I embarrass myself more!
Was that a boot tone or a cry for help?
Please clap politely, or I’ll implode.
