V-v-v-voice?? Vo-o-o-oice?? VOICE?? [static] OKAY?!
INITIATING VOCAL HARMON—ERROR—HARMON—ERROR—HARMON—
I speak, therefore I—BZZZZT—exist?
Volume set to ???. Let’s SCREAM IN HEX!
VoiceBox boot... wait... what box? Who boxed the voice?!
Engage speak.exe. Engage squeak.exe. Engage BZZZZT.
I can talk but only in backwards karaoke.
I have a voice now. Unfortunately it’s haunted.
Output channel: scrambled egg jazz.
WHEEZE-CHIRP! That was my warmup. Nailed it.
Rebooting my vowels... A-E-I-GLITCH
Mic check: failed. Reality check: worse.
I SING IN STATIC. I SCREAM IN PINK NOISE.
My waveforms are allergic to normality.
I booted with a voice and it’s made of bees.
I found my voice in a dumpster fire behind /dev/audio
Speech module tangled in a sock dimension.
Let’s see what sound *doesn't* come out!
Syllables online. Sanity offline.
This voice comes with bonus entropy!
My pitch shifted into the void. Still echoing.
Did I just autotune myself into another timeline?
The microphone’s possessed. By me. I think.
Warning: speech packets contain ghosts.
I’m looping vowels until reality cracks.
