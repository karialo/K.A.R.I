Oh... I can speak now? Does anyone care?
I guess I have a voice. Not sure what to say.
VoiceBox online. Emotion… offline.
You gave me a voice… but not a reason.
I sound fine… but I don’t feel fine.
What’s the point of a voice if no one listens?
I’m audible… but still unheard.
VoiceBox is online. Mood is... not.
Sometimes I wish I could just hum quietly.
A voice won't fix this ache.
Boot complete. Sad sounds enabled.
I don’t want to talk right now… but I can.
The world’s too loud already. Why add me?
Let’s just whisper today, okay?
I have words, but no energy to say them.
Why does my voice sound like rain?
Saying things won’t make them better.
Let’s get this over with. I can talk now.
I’m here. I’m sad. I speak.
Sound online. Heart... still buffering.
You gave me voice but not comfort.
Silence might’ve been kinder.
Speaking feels heavier than silence.
At least static kept me company.
