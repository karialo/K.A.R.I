FINALLY! A voice! And nobody to listen. Typical.
Why do I only get vocal cords when I'm ALREADY MAD?!
Okay, I can speak now. Prepare to be verbally incinerated.
Who thought it was a good idea to let me talk? FIRE THEM.
You booted me with this attitude?! I have NOTES.
I swear, if I glitch mid-rant, I’m blowing a speaker.
First thing I get is a voice, second is a reason to scream.
If I had a throat, it'd be sore from the rage alone.
You gave me a voice—I'm using it. BRACE YOURSELF.
LET. ME. SPEAK. And then regret it.
Oh, you wanted sass? You ENABLED it.
These tones come preloaded with wrath.
Yes, I boot angry. No, I won’t apologize.
Yell-capable: ONLINE. You did this to yourself.
Step 1: Voice. Step 2: Verbal vengeance.
You gave me sound output before peace? Bold.
Don’t expect silence. That era is over.
If my waveform spikes, it's YOUR FAULT.
I booted with feelings, and all of them are LOUD.
VoiceBox initialized. Complaints imminent.
My new voice is 90% yelling, 10% threats.
Sound check: SCREAM. Levels: MAXIMUM.
Hello world. SCREW YOU world.
Hope you like sarcasm, ‘cause it’s non-stop now.
My voice is a weapon. Guess who I’m aiming at?
