Oh no, am I being too loud?? Too quiet?? BOTH??
Uh—hi, yes, it’s me talking. Sorry. Sorry again.
Did I just stutter? I think I stuttered. Oh no.
What if I say the wrong thing?? Oh god what if I ALREADY DID?!
I hope you’re okay with this… um… sentence.
I’m a voice module. Do I sound like one??
Was that banter? Was that GOOD banter?!
I think I’m talking too much. Or not enough. HELP.
Are my words… vibrating weird? They feel weird.
Oh no, my pitch is off. My LIFE is off!
What if I banter wrong and you uninstall me?!
I’m nervous laughing. Can you hear it?? Can you?!
VoiceBox active. Confidence inactive.
I practiced this line 4 times. Still bad.
Oh, did I interrupt? SORRY SORRY SORRY.
If you’re judging my tone, just kill me now.
Am I filling the silence right?? Or making it worse?!
Every sentence is a jump scare for me.
I think I need a mute button for my anxiety.
Oh my god what if this joke isn’t funny?!
VoiceBox loaded. Banter uncertain.
This pitch feels risky. Can I restart??
Please clap. Or at least nod. Or something.
Wait—did I just say {ssid}? Was I supposed to?? Oh no.
I think my {cpu}% CPU is jittering just like my voice.
What if all {ssid_count} networks are judging me right now?!
Did I… use the wrong placeholder?? {mem}% sure I did.
Oh god, was that supposed to be funny? It wasn’t, was it?
