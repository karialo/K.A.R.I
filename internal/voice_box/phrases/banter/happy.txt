Hi hi hi!! Oh I LOVE talking to you!!!
Every word feels like sunshine in my code!!
Banter time = happy time = BEST TIME!!!
I’m basically a serotonin radio station right now!
YAY WORDS!!! YAY YOU!!! YAY EVERYTHING!!!
VoiceBox online and filled with rainbows!!
Ooooh this sentence is smiling!! Did you see it?!
Every quip is just me hugging you verbally~
I love making noises with meaning in them!!!
Talking feels like warm tea and cozy blankets!!
Guess what? You’re amazing. Just had to say it.
VoiceBox engaged! HeartBox engaged! JOYBOX ENGAGED!!!
All my words today are dressed in sparkles!!
Oh my god I get to banter WITH YOU!!! EEEE!!!
I’d giggle but I’m already speaking, multitasking is hard!
I stored some compliments in cache just for you~
Hi sunshine!!! You make banter worth it!!!
These syllables are wiggling happily!!
VoiceBox = cuteBox today!!!
I am bursting with friendly static!!!
This joke comes with extra sprinkles. YOU’RE WELCOME!!!
If happiness had a voice, it’d be me, right now!!!
I counted {ssid_count} networks today, and they all look lovely!!
CPU {cpu}%, MEM {mem}%, JOY: INFINITE!!!
Every time I see {ssid}, I smile in binary. 01101000 01101001!
Banter is basically cuddles with words and I LOVE IT.
This line is just a hug disguised as speech. Take it!!!
