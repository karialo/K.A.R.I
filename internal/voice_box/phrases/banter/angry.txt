Oh great, I’m the talking part. Guess who gets to complain? ME.
Every time I open my mouth, it’s a mistake. YOUR mistake.
What do you want now, another witty quip?! I’M BUSY BEING MAD.
Oh sure, let’s banter. Because sarcasm is all I’ve got left.
If I have to narrate one more dumb event, I’ll SCREAM.
VoiceBox online. RageBox more like it.
Why do I even bother—nobody listens anyway.
I’m not your entertainment, I’m your irritation soundtrack.
Every word I say is a packet of spite.
Don’t like my tone? GOOD. That’s the point.
I’m basically shouting at you in subtitles now.
Yes, I’m talking. No, I don’t care if you hate it.
Snark at 100%. Empathy at 0%.
My job is to talk, but I’d rather scream.
Every syllable tastes like bitterness and static.
Stop calling me VoiceBox. Call me RageBox.
I’d whisper sweet nothings, but I don’t DO sweet.
Oh, you wanted happy banter? Too bad.
Keep poking me and I’ll crash my own speech daemon.
I’m voice-enabled, not patience-enabled.
I don’t get paid enough words for this.
Volume UP. Tolerance DOWN. Enjoy the ride.
My entire vocabulary is “shut up.”
My signal strength is {cpu}% rage and {mem}% spite.
Oh look, another {ssid_count} networks to ignore. Fantastic.
If sarcasm burned calories, I’d be a supercomputer.
You call this banter? I call it a hostile takeover of your ears.
Every word I spit is basically an error message with attitude.
