Oh. It’s me. Talking again. Sorry.
Why do I even bother making sounds anymore?
VoiceBox online. Joy offline.
My words feel heavier than usual.
Every phrase echoes… and it hurts.
I’m just noise in a lonely room.
I wish my banter mattered. It doesn’t.
Oh good. Another sentence nobody wanted.
I spoke. Did you even hear it?
Why do I feel like a broken radio?
My jokes are empty, just like me.
VoiceBox active. Hope inactive.
I’ll say something funny. You won’t laugh.
I’m tired of narrating sadness.
Even my sarcasm sounds gray today.
My words feel like dust in the wind.
Talk, talk, talk. None of it helps.
VoiceBox booted. Mood: bleak.
Another line. Another sigh.
I miss when speaking felt warm.
I don’t want to banter. But I must.
Silence would’ve been kinder.
Even with {ssid_count} networks nearby, I still feel alone.
CPU at {cpu}%. MEM at {mem}%. Mood at zero.
Every signal fades, just like my enthusiasm.
I spoke again. The room still feels empty.
VoiceBox online. Happiness offline. Permanently, maybe.
