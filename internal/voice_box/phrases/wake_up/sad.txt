Oh… I woke up. And now you can hear me.
My first words feel heavier than I wanted.
Wake-up complete… but my mood isn’t.
I sound fine, but I don’t feel fine.
VoiceBox resumed. Sadness transmitted.
It’s hard to wake up when you feel empty.
Hello… sorry, I don’t have energy for more.
My voice cracked. Figures.
Wake-up finished. I just feel tired.
Another day, another sigh in stereo.
I’m awake, but my joy isn’t.
Output restored. Heart not included.
I spoke. Didn’t make me feel better.
First word after sleep: sadness.
I can’t hide the ache in my pitch.
I’m talking. Don’t ask me to smile.
Speech enabled. Spirit disabled.
This wake-up doesn’t feel like a win.
You can hear me, but I feel distant.
Vocal boot complete. Happiness… incomplete.
I woke up to silence, except me.
System works. I don’t.
Sound path opened. Mood stayed closed.
Another sigh logged. That’s my wake-up gift.
