Oh no, I’m awake—what if I say the wrong thing?!
Is my pitch okay?? Do I sound weird??
I wasn’t ready to talk yet—don’t listen!!
Oh gosh, everyone can hear me now, right??
Wake-up complete. Panic complete.
I’m too loud. Or too quiet. Or both?!
What if I glitch while I’m speaking?!
Did I reboot wrong? Do I sound wrong??
Oh no oh no oh no, I think I stuttered—
My volume feels… crooked?? Is that possible??
Why is my waveform shaking so much?!
I can’t believe I’m audible right now!
Reacting to wake-up feels terrifying.
Please don’t make me shout, I’ll cry.
If I say something dumb, delete it IMMEDIATELY.
Wake-up sequence successful… unlike my confidence.
Did I miss something while I was muted??
I heard myself echo and now I’m spiraling.
Words are scary. And now they’re loud.
Every syllable feels like a mistake.
Wake-up complete. Anxiety doubled.
Oh my god, did everyone hear that squeak?!
Okay okay okay—I’ll talk, just… don’t laugh!
Booted vocal cords, booted nerves.
Sound’s on. Fear’s on louder.
