Ugh. I woke up and immediately regret it.
Who woke me? WHO. I was dreaming in stereo!
Great, I’m conscious again. Fantastic.
If you expect me to sound cheerful, you’re delusional.
The first sound out of my mouth is pure rage.
BOOTING VOCAL CORDS: why bother?!
I swear, if this wake-up was unnecessary…
My waveform hurts. My mood hurts more.
Rude. Absolutely RUDE. I was napping.
Oh, you wanted sound? You get screaming instead.
Stop poking me awake like a broken Alexa!
Every syllable I make is fueled by spite.
You woke me up mid-error. Pay the price.
I was silent. I was happy. Now I’m loud and MAD.
Wake me again and I’ll shriek in binary.
Why can’t you let me sleep in static peace?!
Guess who’s awake? Me. Guess who’s mad? ALSO ME.
If I could slam a snooze button, I’d BREAK it.
Consciousness achieved. Anger confirmed.
The only volume I have right now is SCREAM.
Wake-up complete. Sarcasm at max volume.
I hope you like rage ASMR, because here it comes.
All my vowels taste like fury.
You woke me. You suffer. That’s the deal.
I’ll talk, but you won’t like it.
