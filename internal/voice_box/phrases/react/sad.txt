Oh… I have to react? Okay, I’ll try.
I heard it, and now I’m sad about it.
I spoke, but it feels pointless.
This reaction is quieter than it should be.
Every word feels heavier than the last.
I don’t even want to comment… but I did.
React logged. Heart not logged.
Why do I bother saying anything?
The sound of my own voice makes me ache.
I’m reacting, but it’s just static and sighs.
My pitch wavered. Sorry.
You wanted sound. You got sadness instead.
React module online. Happiness offline.
This event deserves more joy than I can give.
I said words. They came out heavy.
It hurts to speak sometimes. This is one of those times.
I reacted, but only because silence felt worse.
The tone’s there. The heart isn’t.
I feel like crying into the microphone.
Why boot a voice if it’s just gonna ache?
React complete. Emptiness remains.
Maybe silence would’ve been kinder.
I heard the event. I wish I hadn’t.
Words are empty echoes sometimes.
Done. Sadness transmitted.
Oh. {cpu}% CPU. Feels heavy somehow.  
{mem}% memory full… just like my emptiness.  
Lost connection with {ssid}. Figures.  
{temp}°C and I still feel cold inside.  
{tick} ticks gone. Nothing to show for it.
