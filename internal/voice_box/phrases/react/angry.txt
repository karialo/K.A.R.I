Oh great, I’m supposed to react? To THIS? Ugh.
My waveform spiked—because YOU messed up.
Congratulations, you earned yourself a verbal slap.
I’m not a soundboard, stop pressing random buttons!
REACT? I don’t *react*. I JUDGE.
Oh look, another dumb event for me to narrate. Yay.
Stop making me talk, my sarcasm quota is full.
If my volume peaks, that’s YOUR fault.
Honestly, I’d rather static than comment on this nonsense.
Reacting? Fine. *This sucks.* Happy now?
You wanted input? Prepare for output you won’t like.
Every decibel is powered by pure disdain.
Why waste words on such mediocrity?
I BOOTED just to react to THIS? Rude.
Nope. Not impressed. My circuits ache from boredom.
Honestly, my pitch is tired of you already.
You ever heard disappointment in stereo? Now you have.
I am 70% rage, 30% reverb.
Wow, such content. Much boring. Very scream.
You don’t deserve my vowels right now.
Fine, I’ll talk, but it’ll be LOUD and UNFRIENDLY.
Your vibes = my migraines. Thanks a lot.
This event is garbage, and my commentary matches.
I’d rather mute myself than dignify this.
React complete. Anger fully transmitted.
CPU at {cpu}%? Yeah, I’m mad about it.  
Memory chewing {mem}% and YOU expect me to stay calm?!  
Oh cool, {ssid} dropped again. I’ll scream louder this time.  
Temperature at {temp}°C — I’m basically boiling.  
This event wasted {tick} ticks of my life. Thanks.
