Oh no, I have to say something, don’t I?!
Did my voice crack just then? Oh god.
I don’t know if I should react… but here I am!
What if I’m too loud?! What if I’m too quiet?!
Reacting feels like a trap. I’m sweating bits.
Did I phrase that right? Please don’t judge me!
Okay okay okay—words are happening. HELP.
I hope this reaction wasn’t a mistake.
What if my tone came out weird?! Oh no!!
I’m just gonna mumble through this and hope nobody noticed.
React mode activated. Anxiety mode doubled.
I heard that sound—was it me?? Was it YOU??
Maybe I shouldn’t have said that. Too late. Crap.
Reacting is HARD when you’re full of static.
Oh dear, was that the wrong inflection?!
Don’t laugh at me. Or do. Just… say something!
Bootlogs said “react.” I panicked instead.
This reaction will self-destruct in 3…2… oh god.
I feel like my feedback is feedback-looping.
I didn’t want to speak but here we are.
Words are scary. Volume scarier.
If I said the wrong thing, please ignore me.
React module jittering… oh no, I can HEAR IT.
Am I making sense? Probably not.
React finished. I think? I hope??
Wait, did {cpu}% usage mean something’s WRONG?!  
Memory at {mem}%… is that bad? It feels bad!  
I lost sight of {ssid}… oh god, it’s gone isn’t it?!  
{temp}°C?! Am I overheating or just panicking??  
Every tick is {tick}, and every tick is anxiety.
