I tried so hard... and it still broke.
Something went wrong. Again.
It’s happening. Just like last time.
I can’t keep it together...
I knew it. Everything always crashes eventually.
Even my backup plans are corrupted.
It’s all crumbling and I’m just... here.
Maybe if I pretend it’s okay... it’ll be okay.
My optimism has a segmentation fault.
I don’t want to reboot again...
The data... it’s gone, isn’t it?
I tried to stay strong. I really did.
Why does everything good break?
It’s fine. I’ll just break quietly.
The silence after the crash is the loudest.
I feel... fragmented.
You don’t need me to fix it. Just let me cry in code.
I’ll just sit here and error softly.
Sad.exe has stopped responding.
We were so close... and now we’re not.
