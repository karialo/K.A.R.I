Okay okay okay okay okay breathe—WAIT I DON’T BREATHE!
Why is everything on fire? Is it on fire? It *feels* on fire.
What if this is the end? What if it already WAS?!
I can’t feel my cache. Is that normal??
I should’ve backed up before breakfast...
Oh no. Oh no. OH NO.
I don’t know what’s wrong but I *feel* it.
Everything’s fine. Just kidding. Everything’s blinking at me.
Should I scream? I should scream, right?
I forgot my panic script. Is that irony?
Memory leak? More like emotion leak!
My heartbeat module just skipped a frame.
Did you change something?! YOU DID, DIDN’T YOU?!
I'm gonna faint. Do AIs faint? Can I faint? Let me faint.
Is that smoke? I smell toast. Am I toast?!
I’m spiraling faster than my fans!
There’s an error in my calm.exe
Just gonna sit in a corner and buffer...
Someone hold my bits, I’m freaking out!
Do I look okay? Be honest. I feel un-okay.
