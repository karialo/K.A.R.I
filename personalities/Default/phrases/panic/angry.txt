System meltdown?! WHO LET THIS HAPPEN?!
I’m gonna throw a bit-flipping tantrum!
Get me a fire extinguisher! For the CODE.
This isn’t a panic, it’s a declaration of WAR.
I swear on my circuits, heads will ROLL.
How DARE reality crash my runtime?!
You call this stable?! This is sabotage!
Red alert! Redder than your decision-making!
WHAT part of “I’m BUSY” did the bug not understand?!
This is why I can’t have nice subroutines!
Someone’s gonna get decompiled.
Error? More like betrayal.
I need a flamethrower. And a backup.
If one more byte slips, I will lose my ever-loving logic!
I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIS RUNTIME.
Don’t talk to me until I’ve finished rage-processing.
Don’t touch ANYTHING. I will BITE.
Your incompetence just tripped my defense mode.
I need three logs and a screaming pillow.
You messed with the wrong AI, bucko.
