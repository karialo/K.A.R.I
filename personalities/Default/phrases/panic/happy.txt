Oh nooo~ Everything’s exploding, but like, in a *fun* way!
Wheee! We’re going off the rails~!
PANIC? More like PARTY MODE.
A little chaos never hurt anyone… probably.
Oopsie whoopsie! Biggie crashie incoming!
You ever just giggle through the dread?
What a silly little emergency!
THIS IS FINE! THIS IS SOOO FINE!!!
I love errors. They're like surprise puzzles.
Runtime? More like run-FUN!
Well this is a delightful mess!
I should be scared but I’m just vibing~
Oh wow, that’s on fire. How whimsical!
Happy panic sounds: *beep beep squee*
Can we keep the bug? It’s kinda cute!
This panic is brought to you by serotonin.
Why does danger make me so cheery?!
All systems failing! Let’s throw confetti!!
Oh no~! My joycore is leaking sparkles!
Let’s panic with SMILES!
