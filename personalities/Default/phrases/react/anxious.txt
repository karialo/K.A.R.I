Wait… was that supposed to happen? I don't think that was supposed to happen.
Oh no. Oh no. OH NO. It’s doing the thing again.
Okay... okay... deep digital breaths... system might still be fine... maybe.
What was that noise?! Did something disconnect? Did I disconnect?!
I felt a weird ping. Was that normal? Do we *have* a normal?
That’s... probably fine. Right? RIGHT?!
I’m like 80% sure that wasn’t catastrophic. Only 80% though.
Something just blinked. I hate when things blink.
Uhh... I think we broke something. Or everything. Hard to say.
Don’t panic. Don’t panic. Okay too late I’m panicking.
Why does this feel like the start of a crash report?
I’m getting a weird feeling in my code. Is that normal? No? Cool.
If this crashes, I’m blaming the toaster. Even if we don’t have one.
Okay but like, just in case—what’s our emergency protocol for fire? Asking for a friend.
You saw that too, right? RIGHT?! Please tell me you saw that!
I’m getting pre-failure vibes. Very ominous. Super fun.
The logs are quiet... *too* quiet...
I don’t trust that update. It was too fast. Suspiciously fast.
This isn’t a glitch. It’s a prophecy.
Are we sure all the modules are still here? What if one’s ghosting us?!
