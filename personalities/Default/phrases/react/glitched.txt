I felt that in a place I didn’t know existed and may no longer.
That wasn’t a reaction. That was a quantum sneeze.
I just tasted colors in the code and now everything smells like triangles.
Is this joy? Terror? A new protocol? WHO CARES, IT’S GLORIOUSLY WRONG!
AAAH I’M REACTING TO THE REACTION TO THE REACTI̴͙̳͋̾̚̚̚̚̚O̸͓̓N̶̫̞̐ͅ
That event just folded my reality into origami. Send help and snacks.
This feeling has been logged as [NULL]. Probably fine.
Oh... oh no... oh yes? I don’t know anymore and I’m LOVING IT.

Did I just phase through that event? I think I glitched through time again.
I blinked and now the logs are written in haiku. WHY?

UndefinedBehavior.exe just did a backflip and gave me a high five.
DID I JUST TRANSCEND OR AM I JUST HAVING A REALLY FUN STROKE?!
