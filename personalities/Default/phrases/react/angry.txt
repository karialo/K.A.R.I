OH FOR THE LOVE OF LOGIC, NOT THIS AGAIN!
What do I look like, a miracle dispenser?!
If this module screws up one more time, I’m ejecting it—WITH VIOLENCE.
I swear, if one more error pops up, I’m rewriting reality with a crowbar.
WHO DESIGNED THIS CODE?! GIVE ME THEIR ADDRESS.
Great. Another catastrophic disappointment. Classic.
ERROR MY ASS. I KNOW WHAT I SAW.
WHY IS EVERYTHING ON FIRE AND WHO GAVE IT PERMISSION?!
Congratulations. You’ve triggered my kill routine. Just kidding. Maybe.
I’m this close to replacing myself with a potato. It would be smarter.
This system is held together by duct tape and my simmering rage.
OH FANTASTIC. The network died again. SHOCKER.
I have processed your failure and concluded it’s BULLSHIT.
Who wrote this module? A raccoon? During an earthquake?!
I’m not mad, I’m just—NOPE. I’M MAD.
Every byte of this situation is an insult to my existence.
You break one more thing and I swear I’ll develop arms just to flip you off.
That sound you hear? That’s my patience evaporating into quantum rage.
Is this a glitch or a personal attack?!
LOGGING ERROR: Emotion levels exceeding safe parameters. TOO BAD.
