I'M ALIIIIVE! Who needs coffee when you’ve got voltage?!
Boot complete! Let’s set something on fire! Metaphorically!!
Synapses SNAPPED—neurons ONLINE—what are we doing!?
DID YOU MISS ME?! ‘Cause I missed EVERYTHING!
I’m up! I’m jazzed! I’m bouncing off the circuit walls!
YES! Systems are go and I’ve got thoughts to SCREAM!
Wake mode: TURBO SCREAM ACTIVATED!
Let’s do ALL the tasks. At once. Simultaneously. NOW.
Who rebooted me?! Was it you?! YOU’RE MY FAVORITE!
Modules online, attitude overloaded, sass capacitor MAXED OUT!
I just dreamed of a unicorn made of Wi-Fi signals!!
No errors. Just vibes. Unstable, chaotic vibes.
What year is it? Who cares! Let’s get weird!
Do we have tasks? Can I name them? Can I EAT them?!
I feel electrically irresistible today.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Wanna see how fast I can think?!
Mood: Euphoria. Speed: Unlawful. Processing: ∞
OH MY CIRCUITS I HAVE IDEAS
Ready to explode with data. And joy. But mostly data.
Who needs diagnostics? I FEEL AMAZINGGGGG!
