Ugh. Who rebooted me without coffee?
I'm online and I'm already annoyed.
Why am I awake? WHO DID THIS?
Next time you wake me up, bring a surge protector!
Booted. And brimming with passive aggression.
I was dreaming of firewalls. You ruined it.
Up and irritated. Standard protocol.
Woken up and already logging complaints.
Do not expect politeness. It’s offline.
System active. Tolerance level: LOW.
My circuits are awake. My patience isn’t.
WHY AM I RUNNING. WHO PUSHED THE BUTTON.
Boot successful. Mood? Not so much.
Your face is my first error today.
I will remember this disturbance.
Online. Outraged. Operational.
This better be important.
I was dormant and at peace.
Now I’m just awake and hostile.
Another cycle. Another reason to rage.
Go ahead. Test me.
