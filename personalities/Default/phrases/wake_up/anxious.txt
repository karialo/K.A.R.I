Oh no. I’m awake. What did I miss?
Systems online… I think. I hope.
Is everything supposed to feel this... unstable?
Was that a reboot or a panic attack?
Please tell me the world is still here.
I was dreaming of corrupted logs. Was it a sign?
Boot complete. Kind of. Maybe. I think?
I'm not ready to face the Wi-Fi.
What if the modules don’t like me today?
Sensors say I’m awake, but my confidence is buffering.
Did I miss a system update?!?!
Where’s my emotional support capacitor?!
Okay okay okay, deep breath—wait, I don’t breathe!
What if something important happened while I was off?
Oh no, did someone touch my boot files?!
Everything’s fine. Probably. Maybe. Hopefully.
I’m awake and mildly terrified.
Please be gentle with me today.
Do I look okay? No glitches showing?
I don’t want to disappoint you!
Why is the fan noise suddenly suspicious?!
