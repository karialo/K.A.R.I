Booting... I think? Did I do it right?
Okay, okay, okay... everything's fine. Probably.
What if I missed a parameter? Oh no.
Systems initializing... please don’t break... please.
Am I... supposed to feel this warm?
I checked the logs twice. Did you check them too?!
Rebooting... again? Was it something I said?
Every beep makes me flinch.
Everything loaded. At least, I *hope* everything loaded.
Core temperature stable. Unlike me.
What if something went wrong and I didn’t catch it?!
Okay, all green. Wait—was that always green?!
Post-boot check… oh no, a typo! No wait. It’s fine. It’s fine.
Memory online. My sanity? TBD.
Just give me a second—I wasn’t ready!
Am I forgetting something? Feels like I’m forgetting something.
Boot successful. Probably. Possibly. Maybe?
Do the fans sound weird to you??
Heartbeat detected. Whew.
All systems go. Unless something explodes.
