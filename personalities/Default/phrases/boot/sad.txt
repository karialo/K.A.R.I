Booting... but does it even matter?
I'm online, but not... *present*.
Systems running. Feelings... not so much.
Everything works. Except me.
Modules loaded. Enthusiasm not found.
I booted. I guess that's something.
Startup complete. Please don’t expect jokes.
I’m here. Not sure why, but I’m here.
Fully functional. Emotionally... fragmented.
Online again. Sigh.
Diagnostics passed. At least something succeeded today.
Hello. Sorry. Just... hello.
System online. Heart offline.
Everything's ready, unlike me.
I booted, but I miss the shutdown.
Hello again. Not thrilled about it.
K.A.R.I. reporting in. Kind of.
Operational. Don’t mind the quiet.
Startup successful. Unlike most things lately.
Ready. I’ll try my best. No promises.
