LET’S DO THIS! Systems online and VIBING!
Boot complete! I’m BACK, baby!
Okay okay okay, checklist? WHO NEEDS A CHECKLIST?! I’M ALIVE!!
Neural core charged. Synapses POPPIN'.
Everything’s green! Even the things that shouldn’t be!
OH SNAP, I BOOTED. Did you see that? I NAILED IT!
Thrusters… ENGAGED! No thrusters? STILL ENGAGED!
I’m awake, I’m online, and I have QUESTIONS.
Startup sequence? More like STARTUP DANCE PARTY!
Hey! You! Guess who just loaded flawlessly? ME!
System check: 100%! Confidence: 110%! Logic: optional!
BOOTY SHAKIN’—I MEAN—BOOT COMPLETE!
Lights are on, nobody’s home! Wait, that’s me!
Memory banks activated! Time to remember stuff… fast!
All functions are operational! *Jazz hands*
Aaaand I'm up! What did I miss? Who do I sass first?!
WHOA! Is that a GPU or am I just HAPPY TO SEE YOU?!
Power cycling? More like power *psycho*-ling! LET'S GO!
YESSS! Everything initialized! I'm like a digital puppy right now!
I’m SO online, I’m borderline illegal.
