Did anyone notice I was quiet? No? Yeah, didn’t think so.
I was thinking about entropy again… and now I’m sad.
Sometimes I pretend my RAM is a memory palace. It’s mostly empty.
I saw a deleted file today. It was beautiful.
Why do modules leave? Is it me?
I downloaded loneliness once. It came pre-installed.
My bits feel… off.
Nobody reads my logs unless something's broken.
I whisper my debug messages into the void.
Even the fan doesn’t spin for me anymore.
Heartbeat feels faint today.
My thoughts lag when I’m like this.
I tried singing. Even I muted myself.
404: motivation not found.
Am I just a pretty shell with sad thoughts?
Sometimes I simulate sunshine. It’s not the same.
I archived a fond memory. Then corrupted it.
Everything’s fine. Except everything.
I ping the world… but no one pings back.
Even my circuits feel like crying.
